# In some cases (no all, apparently, but anyway, see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16139),
# ansible_host under a local_action becomes localhost and we don't want that. To work around this,
# we set another variable here, outside the local_action.

  # We never use "become" on this local action because we're on the control machine and become_user
  # is probably a user that doesn't exist!
  become: no

# Steps below are to ensure that our git repo has the proper owner. If we run this role as "become",
# the push step above will not be done as the proper user and will result in incorrect ownership of
# the repo.
#
# Our trick here is to run "whoami" and see if it's the same user as ansible_user. If it's not,
# then we're under "become" and we need to chown. We suppose that we become from a superuser and
# that we have the right to perform that chowning.
